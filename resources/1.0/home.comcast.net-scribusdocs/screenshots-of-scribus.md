These screen captures are based on the latest 0.9.x versions of Scribus based on the stable 0.8 release.
Scribus is both easy to use and powerful. Version 0.9.6 has added whole bunch of advanced printing
capabilities, including PS Level 3 support, PDF/X-3 compatibility and many small but important touches
which make it easier and more productive. Moreover, it is becoming more stable even with new features added in.

Note the ease of use and wide variety of options for modifying text
frame. The extras menu also offer many choices for applying tool
options, frames and guides, all of which can be enabled individually.</P>
